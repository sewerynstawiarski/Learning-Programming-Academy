In every lesson, Classes that contain "Challenge" in their name are exercises and are, in most parts, code written by myself.
In later lessons, when my solution (although working properly), can differ than the solution of course teacher. That's why
official solution contains "OfficialSolution" or "Solution" in its name. If it's just a "challange," though, the code was written by me.
